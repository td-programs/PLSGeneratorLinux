5: FAQ:
Nobody asked for anything yet. I'm creating this little FAQ, because I would like to provide basic answers that in my view can be usefull for not advanced users.
q. I copied link of my favourite station stream URL to the clipboard. How i can paste it?
A. Please press V, shift+v or ctrl+shift+v in the terminal window.
Q: My file is not working. What did I do wrong?
A: Few ways or things.
Your player might not support PLS files or the stream conveyed in the file. Check it in another player.
If your file doesn't work in other players, please remake it.
If it doesn't fix the problem, please check the stream URL.
If stream URL Was correct, it might be an app-related problem.
You can send email to developers under addres pikselnet404@gmail.com and attach your file.
Maybe together we can find a mistake?
Q. Can I use your Linux code?
a. Yes but please, do not assign yourself all the work. Remember who was the main author of the application and add the link to the source code.
q. Will the program be updated?
a. Maybe?
It's all from FAQ, if you have other questions, it will be nice to talk with you!

6: Thanks to, for?
Thanks to Nuno for help with code.
Thanks to Milka. She gave me an idea to create this little app for Windows and tested first versions in 2017 and began of 2018.

7. Changes:
1.0:
04.07.2018
Initial release. Only PLS file creation awailable.
1.1:
15.08.2024
After a long long time (6 years, really?) i'm back to this version for systems based on Unix  with more knovledge than when i written the first release.
Added:
Possibility of changing the station url or station name if you write an incorect data (Previously you need to rerun the application and start process from scratch. Really i thought that it will be better than write PLS by own hand? xD);
Option to generate an M3U file;
Text displaying in a few lines than the previously;
A completely new readme document, the one you are currently reading which contains all needed information.
Fixed:
Espeak is no longer in use, anyway it said only ee or something like that in the previous version. In 2023 when i tried make this script better i thought about using it to read the version, but finally i resign, because not everyone has it installed in the system;
The text is separated into lines and there are breaks between the display of blocks to make it more readable. You can remove the lines which contain "sleep" if this annoys you.
